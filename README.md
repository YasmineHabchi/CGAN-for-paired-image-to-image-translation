# CGAN-for-paired-image-to-image-translation
Implementation of a Conditional GAN for paired image-to-image translation using a Pix2Pix-like architecture. The model leverages WGAN-GP to stabilize training and enhance image quality. Includes a generator with L1 reconstruction loss and a discriminator with gradient penalty for improved learning dynamics.
